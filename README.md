# Community Bulletin Board

## Project Two Description
For this project we have decided to create a user managed bullentin board webpage where users can search within their community and be able to view or create events that are happening nearby . These posts can include the location of the event, the price of the event and users may have the ability to see future events. This webpage will also give users the ability to create, read, update and delete their posts. 

## User Story
The user will navigate to the webpage and sign in or register to webpage. The user will then have the choice to either click the featured *Today's Event*, *Future Events* or *Community Events* located on the homepage which will direct the user to all events posted on the webpage. Users can create, read, update and delete their posts.

## Planning

For this project we created an ERD *shown above* to demonstrate the connection of pages starting with the bulletin board homepage which will include the three options for posted events. If the user would click on *today's event* or *future events* from the homepage, they would be directed to the page of that specific event that will list all details for the user and they could also leave questions, comments or concerns on the event. If the user were to click on *community events* from the homepage, they would be directed to all events listed and so on.

Next we created a wireframe that would roughly show the frame of what we wanted those pages to look like when we were finished. *shown below*
